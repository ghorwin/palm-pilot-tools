<dl compact="">

<dt><tt>`.coldsyncrc'</tt>
</dt><dd>
	The per-user configuration file for ColdSync. Specifies the
serial device to which the cradle is attached, and the list of conduits
to run for each database.

</dd><dt>Archive file
</dt><dd>
	A file containing records that have been deleted, but which were
marked for archival, usually by checking the "Save archive copy on PC"
box.

</dd><dt>Archive directory
</dt><dd>
	The directory in which ColdSync stores archive files.
<code>~/.palm/archive</code> by default.

</dd><dt>Archived record
</dt><dd>
	A record that has been deleted on the Palm, but saved in an
archive file on the workstation.

</dd><dt>Attic directory
</dt><dd>
	When ColdSync finds a file in the backup directory that has no
corresponding database on the Palm, it moves the file to the attic
directory, in case the database was deleted by mistake. The attic
directory is <code>~/.palm/backup/Attic</code> by default.

</dd><dt>Backup
</dt><dd>
	A file in the user's home directory, containing a copy of a Palm
database.

</dd><dt>Backup directory
</dt><dd>
	The directory in which ColdSync keeps backups of the databases
on the Palm. <code>~/.palm/backup</code> by default.

</dd><dt>Conduit
</dt><dd>
	An external program, run at specific times by ColdSync, which
provides a "hook" by which the user may extend ColdSync's
functionality.

</dd><dt>Database
</dt><dd>
PalmOS's equivalent of files. Often used interchangeably with `files',
if the database in question has been downloaded to a file on a
workstation.

</dd><dt>Database creator
</dt><dd>
	A four-letter string that identifies the application that
created a database. Each application has a unique creator string.

</dd><dt>Database type
</dt><dd>
	Either `record database' or `resource database'.

</dd><dt>Deleted record
</dt><dd>
	A record that has been marked for deletion. Deleted records are
not removed from a database until a sync.

</dd><dt>Dump conduit
</dt><dd>
	A conduit that runs after the main sync, usually to convert a
PDB to some other format.

</dd><dt>Export
</dt><dd>
	To convert a Palm database into another format, often one
readable by another application.

</dd><dt>Expunged record
</dt><dd>
	A deleted record that need not be archived, usually because the
"Save archive copy on PC" box was left unchecked when the record was
deleted.
<p>

	The data portion of an expunged record is immediately reclaimed.
The header, however, is not deleted until a sync.

</p></dd><dt>Fetch conduit
</dt><dd>
	A conduit that runs before the main sync, usually to convert a
file to a PDB.

</dd><dt>Flavor
</dt><dd>
	One of several types of conduit. Each flavor serves a different
purpose.

</dd><dt>Header
</dt><dd>
	A set of input values that ColdSync passes a conduit on standard
input.

</dd><dt>Header field
</dt><dd>
	The identifier on a header line, as opposed to the header value.

</dd><dt>Import
</dt><dd>
	To convert a file, typically one generated by another
application, to Palm database format.

</dd><dt>Install directory
</dt><dd>
	A directory in which ColdSync looks for new databases to upload
to the Palm. <code>~/.palm/install</code> by default.

</dd><dt>Main sync
</dt><dd>
	The phase of a sync during which ColdSync compares the databases
on the Palm with their backups in the backup directory.

</dd><dt>Record database
</dt><dd>
	A database that contains data records, as opposed to a resource
database. Almost all of the "useful information" on a Palm is stored
in record databases. Record database files have a <code>.pdb</code> extension.

</dd><dt>Record identifier
</dt><dd>
	An integer that uniquely identifies a record in a record
database.

</dd><dt>Resource database
</dt><dd>
	A database that contains resources, as opposed to a record
database. Resource databases tend to have a static structure. Palm
applications are resource databases. Resource databases have a
<code>.prc</code> extension.

</dd><dt>Resource identifier
</dt><dd>
	An integer that uniquely identifies a resource among all of the
other resource of the same type in a resource database. The resource
identifier is chosen by the application programmer, and remains
constant.

</dd><dt>Resource type
</dt><dd>
	A four-letter string that identifies the type of data contained
in a resource, e.g. executable code, bitmap images, menu entries, etc.

</dd><dt>Serialized Procedure Call (SPC)
</dt><dd>
	A protocol that allows a Sync conduit to send DLP requests to
the Palm.

</dd><dt>Status code
</dt><dd>
	A three-digit integer by which a conduit can keep ColdSync
informed of its situation, e.g., whether a conduit has succeeded or
failed.

</dd><dt>Sync
</dt><dd>
	<i>vi</i>. To compare the databases on a Palm with those in a
backup directory, and make whatever changes are necessary so that the
two copies have identical contents.

	<i>n</i>. The process of syncing.
