This is a functional (yet always experimental) set of modules to interface
Perl to the pilot-link library. To use it, you will need to perform these
steps:

	perl ./Makefile.PL
	make

If everything is working, you can execute a "make test". If that proves
successful, execute a "make install UNINST=1" as the superuser (root in most
cases) to install this interface into a system-wide location.

	make test
	su - root
	make install UNINST=1

For additional documentation, please read test.pl.
