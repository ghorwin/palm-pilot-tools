What you will find here is a series of "language bindings" which talk
to the core pilot-link libraries and headers for implementation and
public functions.

If you would like to write a perl script for example, that queries the
data on your Palm device, the bindings in the ./Perl subdirectory will
help you with that. Likewise for the ./Java ./Tcl, and ./Python
locations.

Each of them contains a small bit of code that will allow you to "bind"
to the pilot-link subsystem for your needs.
	
If you have any code which uses these bindings, and you feel that
others may be able to use it or benefit from it, we encourage you to
consider contributing it to the pilot-link project for future releases.
