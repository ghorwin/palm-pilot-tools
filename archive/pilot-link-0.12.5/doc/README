The various pieces of documentation for pilot-link can be found here.

Below this tree, you will find various README documents describing how to
configure or connect your Palm device using various methods (such as usb or
libusb).

I have written many HOWTO documents describing how to use your Palm in
various situations, such as over bluetooth, with Evolution, over the network
and so on. You can find those here: 

	http://howto.pilot-link.org/

The manpages are also found here as well. We are keeping them in XML format
for easy maintenance, and these XML sources can be found in CVS, or
publically via the web-view of CVS at the following link:
