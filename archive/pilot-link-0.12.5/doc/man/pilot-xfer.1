.SH NAME
pilot-xfer \- Backup, sync, and restore databases from a Palm handheld device.
.SH "SECTION"

.PP
pilot\-link: Userland conduits

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-xfer\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-e\fR <\fIfile\fR>] [\fB\-b\fR] [\fB\-u\fR] [\fB\-s\fR] <\fIdirectory\fR>

.PP
or

.PP
 \fIpilot\-xfer\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-r\fR <\fBdirectory\fR>] [\fB\-l\fR] [\fB\-L\fR] [\fB\-P\fR] [\fB\-f\fR <\fBdbname\fR>] [\fB\-d\fR <\fBdbname\fR>] [\fB\-i\fR <\fBdbname\fR>] [\fB\-m\fR <\fIfile\fR>] \&.\&.\&.

.PP
Use exactly one of \-brsudfimlI; mix in \-aexDPv, \-\-rom and with\-os\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This is the swiss\-army\-knife of the entire pilot\-link suite\&.

.PP
 \fIpilot\-xfer\fR allows the user to install databases contained in the standard \&.prc (Palm Resource Database), \&.pdb (Palm Record Database), and \&.pqa (Palm Query Application) formats onto a Palm, retrieve databases from the Palm, list the databases contained in a Palm, backup or restore all of the databases at once as well as many other powerful operations performed on a Palm handheld device\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.SS "pilot-xfer options"

.PP
Archive files which have been removed from the Palm to <\fIdir\fR> instead of just deleting (unlinking) them\&.

.nf

   \fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-archive\fR
   <\fIdir\fR>
			
.fi

.PP
Back up the Palm into the specified directory (which will be created if it does not already exist)\&.

.nf

   \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-backup\fR
   <\fIdir\fR>

.fi

.PP
Show information on available cards

.nf

   \fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-cardinfo\fR

.fi

.PP
Permanently delete the specified database(s) by name (without extension)\&. Obviously, be very careful with this one\&.

.nf

   \-\-delete <\fBdbname\fR>

.fi

.PP
Modify \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-i\fR or \fB\-f\fR to use VFS \fIdir\fR instead of internal storage (see examples section for usage)

.nf

   \fB\-D\fR,
   \fB\-\-vfsdir\fR=\fIdir\fR

.fi

.PP
Reads a list of databases from <\fIfile\fR> and prevents \fB\-\-backup\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR, or \fB\-\-update\fR from operating on the listed database(s)\&. A maximum of 100 databases can be excluded\&. Databases should be specified by name without the extension, as displayed with \-\-list, in any order\&.

.nf

   \fB\-e\fR, \-\-exclude=
   \fI<\fBfile\fR>\fR

.fi

.PP
Fetch each specified database out of the Palm into the current directory\&.

.PP
Obsolete\&. Replaced by \fB\-\-rom\fR in v0\&.12\&.

.nf

   \fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-Flash\fR

.fi

.PP
Install each specified file into the Palm\&. Wildcards are valid with this syntax and multiple files may be listed at once\&.

.nf

   \fB\-i\fR, \-\-install
   <\fIfile\fR> [\&.\&.\&.]

.fi

.PP
Note: the behavior of list has changed in version 0\&.12 and later

.PP
List all the databases in the Palm, including OS\-specific native databases\&.

.nf

   \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR

.fi

.PP
Unsupported in 0\&.12 \- see \fB\-l\fR 

.nf

   \fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-Listall\fR

.fi

.PP
Adds the records in each specified file into the corresponding Palm database\&.

.nf

   \fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-merge\fR
   <\fIfile1\fR> <file2> [\&.\&.\&.]

.fi

.PP
Obsolete\&. Replaced by \fB\-\-with\-os\fR in v0\&.12 and later

.nf

   \fB\-O\fR, \-\-\fBOsflash\fR

.fi

.PP
Purge any deleted data that haven't been cleaned up by a full synchronization (this is a safe operation, and will prevent your Palm from accumulating unused data if you delete records but aren't syncing with a PIM\&.) The only information you can lose is archived but un\-synchronized records\&.

.nf

   \fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-Purge\fR

.fi

.PP
Installs all files contained in the named directory to the Palm\&. (Use this to restore your Palm after a hard reset has cleared and wiped its memory, using your backup directory as a baseline)\&.

.nf

   \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore\fR
   <\fIdir\fR>

.fi

.PP
Modifies \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-u\fR, and \fB s \fR, to back up non\-OS dbs from the internal Flash ROM

.nf

   \fB\-\-rom\fR

.fi

.PP
Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which will be created if it does not already exist)\&. Any Palm databases which have not been modified or created since the versions stored in the specified directory will not be backed up\&.

.PP
 \fINOTE\fR: Any Palm databases which have been deleted will have their corresponding backup file removed\&.

.nf

   \fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR
   <\fIdir\fR>

.fi

.PP
Not supported in v0\&.12\&. No replacement\&.

.nf

   \fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-novsf\fR

.fi

.PP
Modifies \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-u\fR, and \fB s \fR, to back up OS databases from internal Flash ROM\&.

.nf

   \fB\-\-with\-os\fR

.fi

.PP
Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which will be created if it does not already exist)\&. Any Palm databases which have not been modified or created since the versions stored in the specified directory will not be backed up\&.

.nf

   \fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-update\fR

.fi

.PP
This will back up the UnsavedPreferences\&.prc file from the Palm\&. Normally this file is not backed up by normal means (Palm recommends that you do not restore this file upon restoration of your device using \fB\-\-restore\fR\&.

.PP
This also modifies the behavior of \fB\-\-backup\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR, and \fB\-\-update\fR\&.

.nf

   \fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-Illegal\fR

.fi

.PP
Execute a shell command for intermediate processing\&. All commands will be done, from left to right on the command\-line, before the connection to the Palm device is made\&.

.nf

   \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exec=command\fR

.fi

.SS "Conduit Options"

.PP
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld\&. If this is not specified, \fIpilot\-xfer\fR will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable\&. If neither are found, \fI pilot\-xfer \fR will print the usage information\&.

.nf

   \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR
   <\fBport\fR>

.fi

.PP
Display version of \fIpilot\-xfer\fR and exit without connecting\&.

.nf

   \fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR

.fi

.SS "Help Options"

.PP
Display the help synopsis for \fIpilot\-xfer\fR and exit without connecting\&.

.nf

   \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR

.fi

.PP
Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting\&.

.nf

   \fB\-\-usage\fR

.fi

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
The program will attempt to connect to a target Palm handheld device and specified port and perform the requested options specified by the user on the commandline\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
To perform a full backup of your Palm handheld:

.PP
# using long options

.PP
 

.nf

   \fIpilot\-xfer\fR \fB\-\-port\fR \fI/dev/pilot\fR \fB\-\-backup\fR \fI$HOME/pilot/Backup\fR
            
.fi
 

.PP
# or over IrDA, using short options

.PP
 

.nf

   \fIpilot\-xfer\fR \fB\-p\fR \fI/dev/ircomm0\fR \fB\-b\fR \fI$HOME/pilot/Backup\fR
            
.fi
 

.PP
To restore that backup to a non\-standard serial port (for example, to a xcopilot or POSE session, assuming you have xcopilot or POSE configured properly for this operation, see the appropriate man pages for details on configuring your emulator):

.PP
 

.nf

   \fIpilot\-xfer\fR \fB\-p\fR \fI/dev/ttyqe\fR \fB\-\-restore\fR \fI$HOME/pilot/Backup\fR
            
.fi
 

.PP
To fetch a file that is on your Palm handheld, such as the Palm Address Book database, you could do the following\&. This will connect to /dev/pilot and retrieve the records found in AddressDB and place them in a local file called AddressDB\&.pdb (Palm Record Database)\&.

.PP
 

.nf

   \fIpilot\-xfer\fR \fB\-p\fR \fI/dev/pilot\fR \fB\-\-fetch\fR \fBAddressDB\fR 
            
.fi
 

.PP
This will connect to your Palm device and install the application Foo (in Foo\&.prc) to your external storage card (typically an SD or MMC card) in the directory /Palm/Launcher on that card, using VFS\&.

.PP
 

.nf

   \fIpilot\-xfer\fR \fB\-p\fR \fI/dev/pilot\fR \fB\-i Foo\&.prc \-D /Palm/Launcher\fR
            
.fi
 

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-xfer\fR written by Kenneth Albanowski\&. This manual page was originally written by Kenneth Albanowski and David H\&. Silber\&. Completely rewritten by David A\&. Desrosiers\&. Updated for 0\&.12 by Neil Williams < linux@codehelp\&.co\&.uk > \&.

.SH "BUGS"

.SS "Known Bugs"

.PP
 \fB\-\-backup\fR will currently truncate/corrupt pdb/prc files if the communication to the device is interrupted during sync (such as removing the Palm from the cradle, or a temporary network hiccup during a NetSync)\&. Ideally, this should restore the original file, or delete the corrupted version and restore the original version back into place, but presently\&.\&. it does not\&.

.SS "Reporting Bugs"

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
