.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-addresses\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-\-delete\-all\fR] [\fB\-t\fR|\fB\-\-delimiter\fR  \fBINT\fR] [\fB\-d\fR|\fB\-\-delete\-category\fR  \fB category \fR ] [\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-\-category\fR  \fBcategory\fR] [\fB\-a\fR|\fB\-\-augment\fR] [\fB\-r\fR|\fB\-\-read\fR  \fIfile\fR] [\fB\-w\fR|\fB\-\-write\fR  \fI file \fR ] [\fB\-C\fR|\fB\-\-human\-readable\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-addresses\fR allows the user to read all entries from a Palm handheld such as those made by \fIPalm\fR, \fIHandspring\fR, \fIHandera\fR, \fITRGPro\fR, \fISony\fR or other Palm handheld in the Palm Address Book application, write new entries into the database, and delete a category or delete all entries in the database\&.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
Provide exactly one of \-\-read or \-\-write\&.

                    \fB\-r\fR,
                    \fB\-\-read\fR=<\fIfile\fR>
                
.PP
Reads records from <\fIfile\fR> and install them to the Palm Address Book application\&. (Use the \fB\-w\fR <\fIfile\fR> option to get a sample "template file" for input records to see how the fields are laid out)\&.

                    \fB\-w\fR, \-\-write=\fIfile\fR
                
.PP
Reads all address book records from the Palm Address Book application and writes them into \fI file \fR 

.SH "OPTIONS"

.SS "pilot-addresses options"

                        \fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-augment\fR
                    
.PP
Augments fields in address book records with additional information\&. The augmented information is placed before and separated from the field with a semi\-colon, (;)\&.

.PP
Augmented information can include any of the following below\&.

.PP
 \fBcategory\fR # Placed in front of each record or\&.\&.

.PP
Placed in front of each phone number field:

.PP
["Work"|"Home"|"Fax"|"Other"|"E\-mail"|"Main"|"Pager"|"Mobile"]

.PP
Empty fields are not augmented\&.

                        \fB\-c\fR,
                        \fB\-\-category\fR=\fBcategory\fR
                    
.PP
Install records to category \fBcategory\fR by default\&. Normally \fIpilot\-addresses\fR uses the \fIUnfiled\fR category by default\&. This option is overridden by the category specified in the record with the \fB \-a \fR option\&.

                        \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\-category\fR
                    
.PP
Delete all records in the specified category \fBcategory\fR before installing new records\&.

.PP
Note that the long name of this option has changed since 0\&.11\&.8

                        \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-delete\-all\fR
                    
.PP
Delete all address book records in all categories\&. Obviously, be \fIvery\fR careful with this one\&.

.PP
Note that the long name of this option has changed since 0\&.11\&.8

                        \fB\-t\fR,
                        \fB\-\-delimiter\fR \fBINT\fR
                    
.PP
Include category in each record, use the delimiter specified to separate all fields of a record\&. Delimiters are specified as follows: 3=tab, 2=;, 1=,\&. This overrides the default delimiter of comma between fields and semi\-colon between a field's augmented information\&. (Please note that this may generate confusing results when used with the \fB\-a\fR option\&.)

.PP
Note that the long name of this option has changed since 0\&.11\&.8

                        \fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-titles\fR

.PP
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld\&. If this is not specified, \fIpilot\-addresses\fR will look for the \fI $PILOTPORT \fR environment variable\&. If neither are found or supplied, \fIpilot\-addresses\fR will print the usage information\&.

                        \fB\-q\fR, 
                        \fB\-\-quiet\fR
