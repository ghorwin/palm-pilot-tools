.SH "PROBLEMS"

.PP
Palm has not published their database format for the thumbnails\&. So, pilot\-foto puts a generic penguin thumbnail for every image uploaded\&. Fotos can be accessed by a named list on the handheld as well as the thumbnails\&. This has been tried on a couple of handhelds\&. It is possible that a foreign palm or different model will not like it\&.

.PP
To get a thumbnail image you can copy the jpegs to the memory card\&. If you copy them back to the handheld they will have a new thumbnail that matches the jpeg\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
This manual page was converted to XML by Neil Williams <linux@codehelp\&.co\&.uk> 

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
If a jpeg is installed with the same name as one already on the palm you will have 2 thumbnails pointing to the same jpeg\&. The new jpeg will overwrite the old jpeg\&.

.PP
If the thumbnail fails to install then the jpeg should be removed\&. It is not\&.

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
