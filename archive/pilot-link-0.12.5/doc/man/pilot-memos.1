.SH NAME
pilot-memos \- Manipulate Memo entries from a file or your Palm device.
.SH "SECTION"

.PP
pilot\-link: Userland conduits

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-memos\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR] [\fB\-d\fR|\fB\-\-delete\fR] [\fB\-f\fR|\fB\-\-file\fR  \fIfile\fR] [\fB\-s\fR|\fB\-\-save\fR  \fIdir\fR] [\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-\-category\fR  \fBSTRING\fR] [\fB\-r\fR|\fB\-\-regex\fR  \fBSTRING\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
By default, the contents of your Palm's memo database will be written to standard output as a standard UNIX mailbox (mbox\-format) file, with each memo as a separate message\&. The subject of each message will be the category\&.

.PP
If '\-s' is specified, then instead of being written to standard output, memos will be saved in subdirectories of \fIdir\fR\&. Each subdirectory will be the name of a category on the Palm, and will contain the memos in that category\&. Each filename will be the first line (up to the first 40 characters) of the memo\&. Control characters, slashes, and equal signs that would otherwise appear in filenames are converted after the fashion of MIME's quoted\-printable encoding\&. Note that if you have two memos in the same category whose first lines are identical, one of them will be overwritten\&.

.PP
If '\-f' is specified, the specified file will be treated as a memo database from which to read memos, rather than HotSyncing from the Palm\&.
