.SH NAME
pilot-install-datebook \- Installs one or more new datebook entries onto your Palm handheld.
.SH "SECTION"

.PP
pilot\-link: Userland conduits

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-install\-datebook\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-r\fR|\fB\-\-read\fR  \fIfile\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-install\-datebook\fR allows the user to create one or more datebook entries from one or more source files\&.

.PP
The format of the source file contains one datebook entry per line, containing four tab separated fields\&. The fields are start date/time, end date/time, alarm settings, and the description of datebook entry\&. This program doesn't yet support repeated entries\&. The date and time must be in format understood by \fIparsedate\&.y\fR\&. At the very least, the following two formats are understood:

.PP
August 11, 1997 0800 GMT+300

.PP
1997/08/11 08:22:33 GMT+300

.PP
If either one of the date and time fields is empty, the entry is installed without time\&. If the alarm field is empty, the entry is installed without setting any alarms\&. The alarm field can contain numbers followed by "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), or "d" (days)\&.

.PP
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld\&. If this is not specified, \fIpilot\-install\-datebook\fR will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable\&. If neither are found, \fIpilot\-install\-datebook\fR will print the usage information\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.SS "Known Bugs"

.PP
If no timezone is given, \fIpilot\-install\-datebook\fR will assume the time is in GMT and it will convert it to localtime\&. If you don't want to create timezone entries for all begin and end times, set the TZ environment variable to GMT before running this program\&.

.SS "Reporting Bugs"

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
