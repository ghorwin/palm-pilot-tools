.SH NAME
pilot-link \- A suite of tools for communicating with Palm handhelds, such as those made by Palm, Handspring, Handera, TRGPro, Sony or other Palm Compatible Handheld PDA device.
.SH "SECTION"

.PP
Pilot\-link: Overview

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The pilot\-link suite of tools contains a series of conduits, libraries, and language bindings for moving information to and from your Palm device and your desktop or server/workstation system, as well as across the network\&.

.SH "TARGET DEVICE"

.PP
The /dev/pilot fallback has been removed in v0\&.12\&. The environment variable \fB$PILOTPORT\fR can be set in your shell, to save specifying the port each time\&. A serial device specified on the command\-line will be used regardless of any \fB$PILOTPORT\fR setting\&. If \fB$PILOTPORT\fR is not set, and \fB\-p\fR is not supplied, all conduits in \fIpilot\-link\fR will print the usage information\&. The default connection rate is 9600 baud\&. You are welcome to try higher baud rates (19200, 38400, 57600 or higher) by setting the \fB$PILOTRATE\fR environment variable, but various machines have various limitations\&. (Be careful about values higher than 115200 on older Linux boxes if you've been using setserial to change the multiplier)\&.

The pilot\-unix mailing list is for discussion and "idea\-sharing" for those interested in using your Palm handheld with UNIX systems\&. This includes people who are interested in helping to develop tools to allow the Palm to operate with UNIX and other POSIX systems, and possibly to develop an SDK (Software Develop\- ment Kit) for the Palm for Unix\&.
