.SH NAME

.SH "SECTION"

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-ical\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-d\fR|\fB\-\-datebook\fR] [\fB\-t\fR|\fB\-\-pubtext\fR  \fBpubtext\fR] [\fB\-f\fR|\fB\-\-file\fR  \fIfile\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Note, this is not the same as the iCal calendar format\&.

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-ical\fR allows the user to retrieve the contents of the ToDo and Datebook databases on a Palm handheld, and convert their contents to an Ical calendar\&.

.PP
Note that the calendar file named by \fIfilename\fR will be deleted, so do not use your main calendar\&. Instead, use a separate one for this purpose, and include it in your main calendar\&.

.PP
As \fIpilot\-read\-ical\fR works by passing a script to ical, the ical application must be in your $PATH\&.
