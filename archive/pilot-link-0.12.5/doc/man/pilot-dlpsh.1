Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld\&. If this is not specified, \fIpilot\-dlpsh\fR will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable\&. If the port is missing and \fI$PILOTPORT\fR is not set, \fIpilot\-dlpsh\fR will print the usage information\&.

                        \fB\-\-version\fR
                    
.PP
Display the copyright information, version number, license details and build details and exit without connecting\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-dlpsh\fR allows the user to connect to a Palm handheld and execute arbitrary DLP commands\&.

.PP
pilot\-dlpsh can query many different types of information from your Palm device, such as username, memory capacity, set the time, as well as other useful functions\&.

.PP
Once connected, the user may execute most of the built\-in \fIDLP\fR commands\&. (See \fIBUILT\-IN COMMANDS \fR below for more detail on currently supported options)\&.

.PP
The connection to the Pilot is kept alive by sending a \fIPadTickle\fR packet to the Pilot after a small period of non\-activity\&. (7 seconds by default)

.SH "BUILT-IN COMMANDS"

.PP
There are many options available while connected to your Palm handheld via \fIpilot\-dlpsh\fR, including the following:

.PP
 \fBuser, u\fR 

.PP
Print the currently set User information, including Username, UserID, PCid, and ViewerID\&. You may also set these values from this command as well\&. To set these values, simply pass the value to the option, such as 'user John Q\&. Public' for example\&.

.PP
 \fBls\fR 

.PP
Used with \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-r\fR to provide long and RAM and ROM file lists, similar to (but slightly different from) the Unix 'ls' command\&. This does not yet allow you to narrow your listing to a certain range of files\&. It will simply list them all\&.

.PP
 \fBdf\fR 

.PP
Display how much RAM and ROM is free on your device, again similar to the Unix 'df' command\&. This does not accept arguments at this time\&.

.PP
 \fBntp, time, dtp\fR 

.PP
Set the time on the Palm from the currently\-set desktop time\&. This does not work on OS version 3\&.3, due to a bug in PalmOS at that time\&.

.PP
 \fBrm, del\fR 

.PP
Remove a file and delete it entirely from the Palm device\&. This is an irrevokable process, and you cannot "undelete" a file, once it has been deleted with this command\&.

.PP
 \fBquit, q, exit, bye\fR 

.PP
Exit the DLP Protocol Shell

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
Passing commandline options to \fBpilot\-dlpsh\fR will allow you to interact with it in unattended mode, for example: '\fBpilot\-dlpsh\fR \-p usb: \-c user' will connect and display the user information, just as if you had connected interactively and typed 'user' at the DLP shell prompt\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
The program will connect to your Palm handheld and give the user an interactive prompt (a "shell") for executing commands across the DLP \fIHotSync\fR protocol\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
 \fBpilot\-dlpsh\fR was originally written by Chris Stevens <stevens@rpi\&.edu> and Damien Neil <neild@rpi\&.edu>

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
