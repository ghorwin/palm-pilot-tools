.SH NAME
pilot-hinotes \- Syncronize your Hi-Notes database with your desktop machine.
.SH "SECTION"

.PP
pilot\-link: Userland conduits

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-hinotes\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-d\fR|\fB\-\-dirname\fR  \fIdir\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Hi\-Notes must be installed on your Palm handheld (and at least one entry must exist within Hi\-Notes)\&.

.PP
By default, the contents of your Palm's Hi\-Notes database (Hi\-NoteDB\&.pdb) will be written to STDOUT as a standard Unix mailbox (in mbox\-format) file, with each memo as a separate message\&. The subject of each message will be set as the category\&.

.PP
The memos will be written to STDOUT unless the \fB\-d\fR option is specified\&. Using \fB\-d\fR will be save the memos in subdirectories of \fIdir\fR\&. Each subdirectory will contain the name of a category on the Palm where the record was stored, and will contain the memos found in that category\&.

.PP
Each memo's filename will be the first line (up to the first 40 characters) of the memo\&. Control characters, slashes, and equal signs that would otherwise appear in filenames are converted using the correct MIME's quoted\-printable encoding\&.

.PP
Please see http://www\&.cyclos\&.com/ for more information on Hi\-Note\&.

.SH "WARNING"

.PP
Note that if you have two memos in the same category whose first lines are identical, one of them will be OVERWRITTEN! This is unavoidable at the present time, but may be fixed in a future release\&. Also, please note that syncronizing Hi\-Note images is not supported at this time, only text\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
Each memo's filename will be the first line (up to the first 40 characters) of the memo\&. Control characters, slashes, and equal signs ('=') that would otherwise appear in filenames are converted using the correct MIME's quoted\\\-printable encoding methods\&.
