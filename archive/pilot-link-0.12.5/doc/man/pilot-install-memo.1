.SH "BUGS"

.SS "Known Bugs"

.PP
The Palm Device has a maximum length of 4,096 bytes (4k) on memopad entries, if you wish to retain the ability to edit the Memo (add/remove/change data within the memo) on the Palm itself\&. You can create a memo entry of 65,490 bytes in size (the absolute maximum) if you do not need to edit the memo entry any further on the Palm device itself\&. Any memo larger than 4,096 bytes and less than 65,490 bytes will not be editable on the Palm itself\&. Consider these memo entries "read\-only"\&.

.PP
This is not specifically a "bug", but a limitation in the PalmOS design itself\&.

.SS "Reporting Bugs"

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
