.SH NAME
pilot-getromtoken \- Reads a ROM token from a Palm Handheld device.
.SH "SECTION"

.PP
pilot\-link: Tools

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-getromtoken\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-t\fR|\fB\-\-token\fR  \fBtoken\fR] [\fB\-s\fR|\fB\-\-sysinfo\fR] [\fB\-\-ram\fR] [\fB\-\-rom\fR] [\fIfilename\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Tokens you may currently extract are:

.PP
adcc: Entropy for internal A\->D convertor calibration

.PP
irda: Present only on memory card w/IrDA support

.PP
snum: Device serial number (from Memory Card Flash ID)

.PP
 \fIpilot\-getromtoken\fR is used to fetch the ROM from your Palm handheld for use in debugging Palm applications through the use of POSE, the \fIPalm OS Emulator application\fR\&.

.PP
Note, because \fIpilot\-getrom\fR uses the low\-level RPC protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use this protocol, you currently cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this utility\&. This will be updated in a future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the debugger protocol\&.

.PP
Write the ROM image to the file named by <\fIfilename\fR>\&. If this is omitted, the filename will be written out as the rom version name as follows: \fI 'pilot\-$VERSION\&.rom' \fR ,where an OS 3\&.5 image would be written as the filename of \fI'pilot\-3\&.5\&.0\&.rom'\fR\&.

.PP
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld\&. If this is not specified, \fIpilot\-getrom\fR will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable\&. If neither are found or supplied, \fI pilot\-getrom \fR will print the usage information\&.

Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
Connect to a target Palm handheld and fetch the ROM for use in debugging Palm applications through the use of POSE, the \fIPalm OS Emulator\fR or with the \fICoPilot\fR application (deprecated)\&.

.SH "LICENSING"

.PP
 \fIWarning\fR: Please completely back up your Palm this program! The developers of \fI pilot\-link \fR are not responsible for any data loss that may occur from the use of this application\&.

.PP
Use of this program MAY place you in violation of your license agreement with Palmsource, Inc\&. or other OEM partners\&. Please read your Palm documentation (specifically the "Software License Agreement") before running this program\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.SH "BUGS"

.SS "Known Bugs"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-getrom\fR does not work with OS5 devices as yet, due to changes in the architecture and design of the Palm HotSync protocol and file type changes from m68k to ARM\&. Other than that, \fIpilot\-getrom\fR has no known bugs at this time\&.

.SS "Reporting Bugs"

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
