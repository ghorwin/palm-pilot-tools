.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR allows a Kodak PalmPix camera user to extract the images from their Palm handheld and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (\&.png) or Portable Pixmap (\&.ppm) files on their system\&. The default output type is Portable Pixmap (\&.ppm)\&.

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR converts all pictures in the files given, or if no files are given, on a Palm handheld, to Portable Pixmap files\&.

lighten or darken the image (0\&.\&.49 darken, 51\&.\&.100 lighten)

                        \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-colour\fR
                    
.PP
Do a simple colour correction\&. The colour correction code makes a histogram from the image\&. Using the histogram it then makes up a couple of colour tables to try and balance the colours\&. It also clips the top and bottom colours to produce better perceived contrast\&.

                        \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
                    
.PP
List picture information found on the Palm handheld instead of converting the entries found to image files\&.

                        \fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR
                        <\fIpixname\fR>
                    
.PP
Convert only \fIpixname\fR to STDOUT, and output as \fBtype\fR: \&.ppm or \&.png\&.

                        \fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stretch\fR
                    
.PP
Do a histogram stretch on the colour planes

                        \fB\-t\fR,
                        \fB\-\-type\fR \fB[ppm|png]\fR
                    
.PP
Specify the output picture type\&. Can be either "png" or "ppm"\&.

.SS "Conduit Options"

                        \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR \fIport\fR
                    
.PP
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld\&. If this is not specified, \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR will look for the \fI $PILOTPORT \fR environment variable\&. If neither are found or supplied, \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR will print the usage information\&.

                        \fB\-q\fR, 
                        \fB\-\-quiet\fR

Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message

                        \fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
                    
.PP
Display version of \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR and exit without connecting\&.

.SS "Help Options"

                        \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
                    
.PP
Display the help synopsis for \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR and exit without connecting\&.

                        \fB\-\-usage\fR 
                    
.PP
Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
If a filelist is not given, connects to the target Palm handheld, and reads the images found in the Kodak PalmPix image database (\fIArchImage\&.pdb\fR), and allows the user to view the list of images and image details, or to select one or all of them, and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (\&.png) or Portable Pixmap (\&.ppm) files to be viewed or printed at the desktop\&.

.PP
If no options are specified, all of the images on the device will be converted to ppm files by default\&.

.PP
If a filelist is given, convert all listed files previously fetched via pilot\-xfer\&. See \fIBUGS\fR \- a single file argument is ignored, a list will work\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix \fR was originally written by Angus Ainslie <angusa at deltatee\&.com > ,and updated by John Marshall <jmarshall@acm\&.org> to include core pilot\-link functionality\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.SS "Known Bugs"

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR's colour correction is nearly as good as Kodak's own, but Kodak has deprecated the PalmPix device, so it is not likely that there will be any updates to their software in the future, so this may be as good as it gets\&. A simple method to improve the look of colours is to do a histogram equalization in your favourite image editor\&.

.PP
 \fIpilot\-read\-palmpix\fR command DOES read from a file, but only if you specify a LIST of files\&. If only one file is given, the command tries reading from \fI$PILOTPORT\fR\&.

.SS "Reporting Bugs"

.PP
We have an online bug tracker\&. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed\&. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of accountability\&. Please point your browser to http://bugs\&.pilot\-link\&.org: \fIhttp://bugs.pilot-link.org\fR and report your bugs and issues there\&.
