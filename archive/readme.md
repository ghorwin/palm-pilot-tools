# Archives tools and software

As with the disappearance of pilot-link.org I fear the same may happen with other libraries and documentation pages as well. So while browsing the web for Palm-related resources,
I'm storing every bit of data related in this archive directory.

## Source code / Libraries

- `pilot-link-0.12.5` source code is copied from https://github.com/jichu4n/pilot-link; I believe this is the latest source code version.
- `coldsync-3.0` source code is taken from https://github.com/dwery/coldsync; while the repo is store active, there does not seem to be active development anylonger (no surprise)

## prc
Palm software, copied from all over the web (btw, there where lots of 404s while following the links :-). Not curated though, but maybe there is some software available that you like. License information is in the zip files.

## Tools

Software tools for the Palm, Windows versions, useful if you like to setup a virtual machine with software from the days when the Palm devices where still being sold.
