# Downloads of old tools

Old software installers tend to get lost or at least become harder to find in the web. 
This directory contains some of the older tools I found and archived here.

Windows executables have been renamed `.exe.removethis` (so just rename them back to `.exe` after download) to avoid
problems with git clients and virus scanning tools.

## Palm Desktop

The Windows XP (and potentially later versions) Desktop Sync Software. Version 4.1.4 is the latest 
version that works ok, newer versions (6.x) are buggy and lots of people (including myself) had problems
with Palms of the 2004/2005 years, including my TX.
